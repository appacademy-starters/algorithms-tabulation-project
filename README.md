This project contains two test-driven problems and one problem on LeetCode.com.

* Clone the project from
  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/algorithms-tabulation-project.
* `cd` into the project folder
* `npm install` to install dependencies in the project root directory
* `npm test` to run the specs
* You can view the test cases in `/test/test.js`. Your job is to write code in
  the `/lib` files to pass all specs.
  * In `problems.js`, you will write code to make the `stepper`,
    `maxNonAdjacentSum`, and `minChange` functions pass.
  * In `leet_code_64.js`, you will use that file as a scratch pad to work on the
    LeetCode.com problem at https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/.
  * In `leet_code_70.js`, you will use that file as a scratch pad to work on the
